// You process shml by making an instance of this and passing your TEXT
// SHML to instance.process(text), receiving back your xml output, or an exception
// if something went wrong.

// QUICK NOTE: SHMLClass.process is the only public method, taking text, and returning text.

// SUMMARY:

// SHML stands for "Short-Hand-Markup-Language" and is a wonderfully timesaving method of writing programs in the Nametag Workshop without all that tiring "closing of tags" that is almost the trademark of writing in HTML.

//We chose a previous example, "Views within Views", to illustrate how SHML works. This is exactly equivalent to that example except you'll notice (almost) no close tags in the below.

//SHML is written exactly like HTML, except: 

//    0) Always use correct indentation 
//    1) Never use close tags for a tag opened at the start of a line; tag contents may continue on the same line, or indented on the next. 
//    2) You can have more than one tag on a line; all but the first must be closed normally. 
//    3) Comment blocks must open at the start of a line, and close at the end of one. 
//    4) there is no 4.

//We find it takes a short period of adjustment and then you'll probably want to use it for every project thereafter. It saves a lot of typing and leads to beautiful code.
